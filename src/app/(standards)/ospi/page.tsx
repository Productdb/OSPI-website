          <h2 className="mb-4">What is the OSPI Protocol?</h2>
          <p>
            OSPI (Open Standard Product Identification) is an open-source, free-to-use protocol that enables businesses to generate unique product identifiers 
            without needing to register with a central authority. Unlike traditional systems like GTIN, OSPI allows complete flexibility and control over 
            product identification, making it easier for businesses of all sizes to operate globally without the burden of licensing fees.

          <h2 className="mb-4">How the OSPI Protocol Works</h2>
          <p>The OSPI protocol is designed to be simple yet robust enough for global commerce. Hereâ€™s how it works:</p>
          <ul className="list-unstyled">
            <li className="mb-3">
              <strong>1. Generate Your OSPI Code:</strong> Businesses can generate a unique OSPI code using the OSPI Code Generator. This code serves as the unique identifier for each product.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-3">
              <strong>2. Integrate the Code:</strong> Once generated, the OSPI code can be printed as a barcode, embedded in digital product catalogs, or integrated into inventory management systems.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-3">
              <strong>3. Global Recognition:</strong> The OSPI protocol is built to be compatible with global supply chains and can be scanned or recognized by any system that supports barcode technology.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>4. No Centralized Fees or Registration:</strong> Unlike other systems, OSPI does not require businesses to pay fees or register with a central body. The protocol is entirely open and free.
            </li>
          </ul>
